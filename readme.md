# Monkey Chunky App

Monkey Chunky App is designed to help early stage readers practice reading words. The user can enter any word and the app will break it down into phonic chunks. User can tap on the phonic chunks to hear the corresponding sound of the phones that make the word.

This application is taking input from the user and giving the readers the output in a very interactive way,it is way helpful to small children who are learning the new words and prouncation basically a pre-school edtech application giving the students an easy way to learn.

I created this using JSX,React Native and ExpoGo in Visual Studio Code,JSX-the language on which Facebook was once created offers a great variety for the developers to code,a leading language.It is a mobile android/ios application making it much portable 

In order to run the code,
The user has to enter these commands in the terminal
npm install
npx expo start 
Then scan the QR code in the terminal 
Hurray!The app will run (Please ensure you have downloaded the Expo Go Application and you are connected with the same wifi in the phone/tablet and laptop/desktop)
